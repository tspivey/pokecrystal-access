## Introduction
The Pokecrystal access project is a set of scripts which provide access to Pokémon Crystal, the famous GameBoy game, for people using a screen reader.
These scripts are designed to work with the VBA-ReRecording GameBoy emulator.
  
## Requirements and installation
1. Download the GameBoy emulator VBA Rerecording
http://vba-rerecording.googlecode.com/files/vba-v24m-svn-r480.7z

1. Get an English pokémon crystal rom.

1. After you have these, extract and run VBA.

1. Go to the Options menu, Head-Up Display, Show Speed, None (alt-o, h, s, enter)
Without this, NVDA reads the title bar every time it changes.
1. Optional but recommended: turn down the sound. In the Options menu, navigate to Audio, Volume (alt o, a, v)

##Starting the game
Each time you run VBA, you'll need to load the rom.
You can do this from the open dialog, or load a recent rom after you've opened it once.

Once the rom is loaded, load the lua script (tools, lua, New Lua script window).
From there, load pokemon.lua, press run. It should say ready, alt tab out and back in again

##Keys
Make sure num lock is off while playing the game, or the keys won't work.

* j, k and l - previous, current and next item
* shift m - read current map name
* shift n - rename current map
* n - rename current item
* t - read text on screen, if any
* p - pathfind. This tries to find a path between you and the object selected, or as close as it can get.
* c - read coordinates
* h - read enemy health if in a battle
* shift u - Orient map viewer focus to the position of the player.
* shift i, k, j and l - Move the map viewer focus up, down, left and right respectively. The tile that is being focused will be announced, along with any objects on that tile. As of onw it does not announce connections.
* shift p - Pathfind to the currently focused tile.
